title: '[MLSys Seminar] Rapid LLM deployments: with great power comes great responsibility'
date: '2024-04-20'
tags: ['talks']
draft: false
authors: ['mlsys', 'faculty/zhao_jishen']
summary: With the ubiquitous use-cases of modern LLMs, the deployment scale of these models is unforeseen. This has led to a large-scale datacenter expansion with GPUs, currently running into an energy wall worldwide. This talk will focus on the properties of generative LLMs that can be used to make the deployment of these models more power-efficient. The talk will also introduce POLCA and Splitwise, two techniques to reduce the power consumption for the LLM serving.

Our MLSys seminars kick off with the first talk by Esha Choukse from MSR Azure Research. It is going to happen on **4/29 at 3:30pm in CSE1242**. We will perhaps opt to a hybrid seminar with Zoom attendance accommodated.

**Talk title:** Rapid LLM deployments: with great power comes great responsibility

**Talk Abstract:** With the ubiquitous use-cases of modern LLMs, the deployment scale of these models is unforeseen. This has led to a large-scale datacenter expansion with GPUs, currently running into an energy wall worldwide. This talk will focus on the properties of generative LLMs that can be used to make the deployment of these models more power-efficient. The talk will also introduce POLCA and Splitwise, two techniques to reduce the power consumption for the LLM serving.
