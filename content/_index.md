      title: UC San Diego ML Systems Group
      text: '**We are a group of faculty, researchers, and students pushing the frontiers of systems for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) and their applications**.

      - Our current members span [the Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) (CSE) and [the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) (HDSI) [the Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [the University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). We invite all interested people to join our seminar mailing list. 

      - Our research interests include:

      * - Systems for ML/AI training, tuning, inference, and serving
  
      * - ML/AI for building systems (e.g., OS, network systems, etc.)

      *	- ML compilers and runtimes

      *	- Distributed and hardware-aware ML/AI methods

      *	- New hardware for ML

      *	- Data preparation for ML/AI applications
 
      *	- ML/AI system benchmarks and datasets

      *	- AI agents and augmented AI

      *	- Applications of ML systems (e.g., IoT, natural sciences, public health, etc.)'
